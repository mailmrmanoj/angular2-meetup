# Angular2-Meetup
Setup for Angular2

##Steps:
* Install Node.js
* Clone this repo or download
* navigate to root of this Repo on command Line
* Run the command npm Install (it will install required dependencies as per package.json)

If you don't receive any error during npm install 
then node_modules and typings folder will be created with all the libraries.

If the typings folder doesn't show up after npm install please install them manually with:
npm run typings -- install

I have tried with node v4.4.4 and npm version 2.15.1
run node -v and npm -v to check version

you can do the setup cloning angular quickstart repo as well
https://github.com/angular/quickstart

Angular quickstart repo is having libraries used for testing as well which I have removed for simplicity.
